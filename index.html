        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p><em>Whilst spectating a live baseball game</em>, players will pass around a "cup" which serves as a pot in chronological order (in this case it is a computer or a phone). The cup is to be passed when there is a new at-bat in the baseball game. When it is a player's turn to hold the cup, they will ante a dollar into it. Based on the result of the at-bat, the player holding the cup may have an opportunity to then remove money from the cup before passing it to the next player as outlined in the scoring below. The game ends when the baseball game ends, or one person collects all the money, or whenever you feel like it quite frankly.</p>
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Add $1 to the cup every time the cup is received*</li>
          <li>Remove $1 from the cup for the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Single</li>
            <li>Walk or HBP</li>
            <li>RBI**</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Remove $2 from the cup for a double***</li>
          <li>Remove $3 from the cup for a triple***</li>
          <li>Remove all the money in the cup for a home run</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="caveat">* This amount can be changed for any "High Rollers" out there. Be aware that once you run out of money you are out of the game.</p>
        <p class="caveat">** Each RBI is $1, batters can get up to 4 RBIs during an at-bat.</p>
        <p class="caveat">*** If there are fewer dollars in the cup than are owed to the player holding the cup, tough luck.</p>
